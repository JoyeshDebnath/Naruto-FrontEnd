			"The Hokage position was created shortly after the creation of Konoha by Hashirama Senju, one of the village's founders. He intended the title to be given to his co-founder, Madara Uchiha, but the village's population instead selected Hashirama as the First Hokage. Madara feared that Hashirama's selection was the first step in making the Hokage office an extension of the Senju clan's authority, a fear Hashirama denied",

If the occupant of the post die or reported missing after a long period of time, the next Kazekage is chosen by the Suna Council. Once the duties of the position are assumed, they usually move to the Kazekage's Office.",

Although it is unclear whether the Second was related to the First, he had been his personal bodyguard and the Third's teacher.
